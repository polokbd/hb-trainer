        <h1>My Recipes</h1>
        <p>I’m passionate about helping people find the right balance for them, which means that they can enjoy their lives to the fullest whilst looking, feeling and performing how they want to.

            I’ve been a coach since 2008 and I’ve worked with hundreds of people in that time. I’ve also worked with professional athletes, celebrities including actresses and TV presenters and contributed workouts and fitness content for Vicky Pattison’s hugely successful book, ‘The Real Me’.</p>
